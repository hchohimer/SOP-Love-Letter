          though at first thou seemest a stranger. Indifferent with thou cold command line. Still then I was bewitched at first sight.  Erre long I grew to know you, so much better than I ever imagined. And yet, from first git init I have known only my gratitude to you.  As our lives progressed we began to build files of our life committing them to the repositories of our hearts.  And when times are rough, when we have done all we can and realize the only way forward lie back, thou resets me back to better days.  Truly Git you define that which separates the mere hobbyist from the grand developer, boring web creation against true mastery.
