      <p>
          Bash, oh magnificent bash, your brilliance lights up my monitor.  Though I have but a PC, still you grace me with your presence, and grant me Linux commands.  You’ve been with me from the very beginning and yet I never knew you till now. Harken though as once I cd into mine own heart, and look back through pwd upon the path I’ve traveled, I realize you’ve been with me all along.  When my hard drive felt alone, you ssh’d thineself into my heart. and when I felt like there was nowhere to go, you ls’ed my options.  Thine accomplishments shine upon us all, the developers and designers, the webmasters and the script kiddies. When a text editor is required, you are the first to open and the last to quit, your utility is boundless.  Stay with me forever my love and we will do great things, change worlds, build web pages, upload git repositories and master all space and time.
